Today: Wrangling data 

Data wrangling, sometimes called data munging, is the process of transforming data from one format into another so as to make it easier to interpret it.

The {dplyr} package includes functions that wrangle data frames in a friendly and logical way. We were introduced to data frames last week. 

The functions perform operations on data frames and return data frames. Operations include selecting columns, filtering rows, re-ordering rows, adding new columns, and summarizing data.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Let's look at these using the `airquality` data frame. Recall the object `airquality` is a data frame containing New York air quality measurements from May to September 1973. (`?airquality`). 

We can summarize the values in each column with the `summary()` method.
```{r}
summary(airquality)
```

## Pipe operator

Importantly we can apply the `summary()` function using the pipe operator (`%>%`). The pipe operator is part of the {dplyr} package and when used together with the wrangling functions, it provides a easy way to make code easy to read.

For example, we read the pipe as THEN. "`airquality` data frame THEN summarize".
```{r}
airquality %>% 
  summary()
```

The pipe operator allows us to string together functions while keeping the code readable. We want our code to be machine readable (correct syntax) but also human readable.

For example, suppose the object of interest is called `me` and suppose there is a function called `wake_up()`. I can apply the function in two ways.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
wake_up(me)
me %>% 
  wake_up()
```

The second way involves a bit more typing but it is easier for someone to read and thus it is easier to understand. This becomes clear when stringing together many functions. 

For example, what happens to the result of `me` after the function `wake_up()` has been applied? How about `get_out_of_bed()` and then `get_dressed()`? I can apply these functions in two ways.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me)))

me %>%
  wake_up() %>%
  get_out_of_bed() %>%
  get_dressed()
```

Continuing
```{r, eval=FALSE}
me %>%
  wake_up() %>%
  get_out_of_bed() %>%
  get_dressed() %>%
  make_coffee() %>%
  drink_coffee() %>%
  leave_house()
```

Which is much better in terms of 'readability' then `leave_house(drink_coffee(make_coffee(get_dressed(get_out_of_bed(wake_up(me))))))`.

Consider again the `FLp.df`. 
```{r}
loc <- "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/FLprecip.txt"
FLp.df <- read.table(loc, 
                     header = TRUE,
                     na.string = "-9.900")
```

How would we use the above readable syntax to compute the mean value of June precipitation?

We ask three questions: what function, applied to what variable, from what data frame? Answers: `mean()`, `Jun`, `FLp.df`. We then write the code starting with the answer to the last question first.
```{r}
FLp.df %>%
  pull(Jun)
```

The function `pull()` from the {dplyr} packages pulls out the column named `Jun` and returns a vector of the values.

Then the `mean()` function takes these 118 values and computes the average.
```{r}
FLp.df %>%
  pull(Jun) %>%
  mean()
```

IMPORTANT: the next function in the sequence receives the output from the previous function as its FIRST argument so the function `mean()` has nothing inside the parentheses. 

(1) Use the piping operator and compute the average wind speed in the `airquality` data frame.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  pull(Wind) %>%
  mean()
```

(2) Use the piping operator and compute the 10th and 90th percentiles (lower and upper decile values) of May precipitation in Florida.
```{r}
FLp.df %>%
  pull(May) %>%
  quantile(probs = c(.1, .9))
```

## Wrangling data frames

We will wrangle our data with functions from the {dplyr} package. The functions work on data frames but they work better if the data frame is a _tibble_. Tibbles are data frames that make life a little easier. 

R is an old language, and some things that were useful 10 or 20 years ago now get in the way. To make a data frame a tibble (tabular data frame) type
```{r}
airquality <- as_tibble(airquality)
class(airquality)
```

Click on `airquality` in the environment. It is a data frame. We will use the term tibble and data frame interchangeably.

### Selecting and filtering

The function `select()` chooses variables by name to create a data frame with fewer columns. For example, choose the month, day, and temperature columns from the `airquality` data frame.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  select(Month, Day, Temp)
```

Suppose we want a new data frame with only the temperature and ozone concentrations.
```{r}
df <- airquality %>%
        select(Temp, Ozone)
df
```

We include an assignment operator (`<-`, left pointing arrow) and an object name (here `df`).

Note: The result of applying most {dplyr} verbs is a data frame. The take only data frames and return only data frames.

The function `filter()` chooses observations based on specific values. 
![filter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/dplyr_filter.jpg)

Suppose we want only the observations where the temperature is at or above 80F.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  filter(Temp >= 80)
```

The result is a data frame with the same 6 columns but now only 73 observations. Each of the observations has a temperature of at least 80F.

Suppose we want a new data frame keeping only observations where temperature is at least 80F AND winds less than 5 mph.
```{r}
df <- airquality %>% 
  filter(Temp >= 80 & Wind < 5)
df
```

### Example: Palmer penguins

Let's return to the penguins data set we saw in Lesson 2. The data set is located on the web, and we import it as a data frame using the `read.csv()` function.
```{r}
loc <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv"
penguins <- read.csv(loc)
penguins
```

To keep only the penguins labeled in the column `sex` as `female` we type
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "female")
```
  
To filter rows keeping only species that are not Adalie penguins.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(species != "Adelie")
```

When the column of interest is a numerical, we can filter rows by using greater than condition. For example, to create a data frame containing the heaviest penguins we filter keeping only rows with body mass greater than 6000 g.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(body_mass_g > 6000)
```
  
Similarly, we can also filter rows of a data frame with less than condition. For example, to create a data frame containing only penguins with short flippers we filter keeping only rows with flipper length less than 175 mm.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(flipper_length_mm < 175)
```
  
We can also specify more than one conditions. For example to create a data frame with female penguins that have larger flippers we filter keeping only rows with flipper length greater than 220 mm and with sex equal to female.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(flipper_length_mm > 220 & 
         sex == "female")
```

We can also filter a data frame for rows satisfying one of the two conditions using OR. For example to create a data frame with penguins have large flippers or short bills we filter keeping rows with flipper length of at least 220 mm or with bill depth less than 10 mm.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(flipper_length_mm > 220 | 
         bill_depth_mm < 10)
```
  
Often we want to remove rows if one of the columns has a missing value. With `is.na()` on the column of interest, we can filter rows based on whether or not a column value is missing.

Note the `is.na()` function returns a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs
```{r}
is.na(airquality$Ozone)
```
The first four rows of the vector `Ozone` in the `airquality` data frame are not missing so the function `is.na()` returns four `FALSE`s. 

When we combine that with the `filter()` function we get a data frame containing all the rows where `is.na()` returns a `TRUE`. For example, create a data frame containing rows where the bill length value is missing.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
 filter(is.na(bill_length_mm))
```
 
Usually we will want to do the reverse of this. That is keep all the rows where the column value is not missing. In this case we use negation symbol `!` to reverse the selection. In this example, we filter rows with no missing values for `sex` column.
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sex))
```

Note that this filtering will keep rows with other column values that are missing values but there will be no penguins where the `sex` value is `NA`.

### Stringing functions together

The function `arrange()` orders the rows by values given in a particular column.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  arrange(Solar.R)
```

The ordering is from lowest value to highest value. Here we see the first 10 rows. Note `Month` and `Day` are no longer chronological.

Repeat but order by the value of air temperature.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  arrange(Temp)
```

Importantly we can string the functions together. For example select the variables radiation, wind, and temperature then filter by temperatures above 90F and arrange from coolest to warmest by temperature.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  select(Solar.R, Wind, Temp) %>%
  filter(Temp > 90) %>%
  arrange(Temp)
```

The result is a data frame with three columns and 14 rows arranged by increasing temperatures above 90F. 

The `mutate()` function adds new columns to the data frame. 
![mutate](figures/dplyr_mutate.png)

For example, create a new column called `TempC` as the temperature in degrees Celcius. Also create a column called `WindMS` as the wind speed in meters per second.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  mutate(TempC = (Temp - 32) * 5/9,
         WindMS = Wind * .44704) 
```

The resulting data frame has 8 columns (two new ones) labeled `TempC` and `WindMS`.

On days when the temperature is below 60 F add a column giving the apparent temperature based on the cooling effect of the wind (wind chill) and then arrange from coldest to warmest apparent temperature.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  filter(Temp < 60) %>%
  mutate(TempAp = 35.74 + .6215 * Temp - 35.75 * Wind^.16 + .4275 * Temp * Wind^.16) %>%
  arrange(TempAp)
```

### Summarize

The `summarize()` function reduces (flattens) the data frame based on a function that computes a statistic. For example, to compute the average wind speed during July type
```{r}
airquality %>%
  filter(Month == 7) %>%
  summarize(Wavg = mean(Wind))

airquality %>%
  filter(Month == 6) %>%
  summarize(Tavg = mean(Temp))
```

We've seen functions that compute statistics on vectors including `sum()`, `sd()`, `min()`, `max()`, `var()`, `range()`, `median()`. Others include

Summary function  | Description
-----------------:|:-----------
`n()`             | Length of the column
`first()`         | First value of the column
`last()`          | Last value of the column
`n_distinct()`    | Number of distinct values

Find the maximum and median wind speed and maximum ozone concentration values during the month of May. Also determine the number of observations during May.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  filter(Month == 5) %>%
  summarize(Wmax = max(Wind), 
            Wmed = median(Wind), 
            OzoneMax = max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE), 
            NumDays = n())
```

Why do we get an `NA` for `OzoneMax`? 

We fix this by including the argument `na.rm = TRUE` inside the `max()` function.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  filter(Month == 5) %>%
  summarize(Wmax = max(Wind),
            Wmed = median(Wind),
            OzoneMax = max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
            NumDays = n())
```

### Grouping

If we want to summarize separately for each month we use the `group_by()` function. We split the data frame by some variable (e.g., `Month`), apply a function to the individual data frames, and then combine the output.

Find the highest ozone concentration by month. Include the number of observations (days) in the month.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarize(OzoneMax =  max(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
            NumDays = n())
```

Find the average ozone concentration when temperatures are above and below 70 F. Include the number of observations (days) in the two groups.
```{r}
airquality %>%
  group_by(Temp >= 70) %>%
  summarize(OzoneAvg =  mean(Ozone, na.rm = TRUE),
            NumDays = n())
```

On average ozone concentration is higher on warm days (Temp >= 70 F) days. Said another way; mean ozone concentration statistically depends on temperature.

The mean is a model for the data. The statistical dependency of the mean implies that a model for ozone concentration will likely be improved by including temperature as an explanatory variable.

To summarize, the important verbs are

Verb          | Description
-------------:|:-----------
`select()`    | selects columns; pick variables by their names
`filter()`    | filters rows; pick observations by their values
`mutate()`    | creates new columns; create new variables with functions of existing variables
`summarize()` | summarizes values; collapse many values down to a single summary
`group_by()`  | allows operations to be grouped

The syntax of the verb functions are all the same:

Properties
* The first argument is a data frame. This argument is implicit when using the `%>%` operator.
* The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. We refer to columns in the data frame directly (without using `$`).
* The result is a new data frame

These properties make it easy to chain together many simple lines of code to do something complex.

The five functions form the basis of a grammar for data. At the most basic level, we can only alter a data frame in five useful ways: we can reorder the rows (`arrange()`), pick observations and variables of interest (`filter()` and `select()`), add new variables that are functions of existing variables (`mutate()`), or collapse many values to a summary (`summarise()`).

## Your turn

Consider again the Florida precipitation data set (http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/FLprecip.txt). Import the data as a data frame, select the columns `April` and `Year`, group by years > 1960, then compute the mean and variance of the April rainfall with the `summarize()` function.
