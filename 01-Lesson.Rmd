* Is it getting hotter in Tallahassee?
* Are hurricanes getting stronger?

Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge.

## What is this course?

This is a first course on data science for geographers.

**Q - What statistics background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - Statistics and data science are closely related with much overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. But this course is **not** your typical high school/college statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

**Q - Is this an introduction to computer science course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

**Q - Why not language some other language?**  
A - We can discuss that over coffee (Zoom only).

### Course Syllabus

- Log on to RStudio Cloud and click on this course's Space (Quantitative Geography Using R).
- Click on the project `00_Syllabus` and launch it.
- Open the `00-Syllabus.Rmd` file (lower-right panel), and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Review

### Tallahassee Daily Temperatures

- Click on the project `01_Lesson` and launch it. When you access a project created by someone else, RStudio Cloud automatically creates a temporary copy of the original project for you. You can play with and make edits to it, but none of your changes will be reflected in the original. 
- To keep the changes youâ€™ve made, just save a copy of the project for yourself by pressing the Save a Permanent Copy button.
- In the Files pane in the bottom right corner, locate the file called `Tallahassee_Temperatures.Rmd`. Open it, and then click on the "Knit" button.
- Go back to the file and change your name on top (in the `yaml` -- we'll talk about what this means later) and knit again.
- Then, change the temperature from `TMAX` to `TMIN`. Make other adjustments accordingly. Knit again. Voila, your first data visualization!
