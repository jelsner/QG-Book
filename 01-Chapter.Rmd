# Getting Started

**"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."** --- Martin Fowler

We will use RStudio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/) throughout the semester.

![RStudio Cloud's landing page](figures/RStudioCloudLanding.png)

If you prefer to work with R and RStudio on your own computer (without RStudio Cloud) then

First get R

* Point browser to http://www.r-project.org.
* Select the CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). Scroll to a mirror site. 
* Choose the appropriate file for your hardware.
* Follow the instructions to install R.

Then get RStudio

* Click on http://rstudio.org
* Download RStudio Desktop
* Install and open RStudio

## RStudio's integrated development environment (IDE)

* Written in HTML
* Top menus
  + File > New File > R Markdown
  + Tools > Global Options > Appearance
  
* Upper left panel is the markdown file. This is where we add text and code. 

  + Run code chunks from this panel 
  + Output from the operations can be placed in this panel or in the Console (see the gear icon above)
  + All the text, code, and output can be rendered to an HTML file or a PDF or Word document (see the Knit button above)
  
* Upper right panel shows what is in your current environment and the history of the commands you issued.

## Basic R

Applied statistics is the analysis and modeling of data. The `c()` function gets small lists of data items into R. The function combines (concatenates) items. Consider for example a set of hypothetical annual land falling hurricane counts over a ten-year period.

2  3  0  3  1  0  0  1  2  1

We put these count values into our working directory by typing them into the console as follows. The console is the lower left window.
```{r chapter1}
counts <- c(2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1)
counts
```

We assign the values to an object called `counts`. The assignment operator is an equal sign (`<-` or `=`).  Values do not print. They are assigned to an object name. They are printed by typing the object name as we did on the second line. When printed the values are prefaced with a `[1]`. This indicates that the object is a vector and the first entry in the vector has a value of 2 (The number immediately to the right of `[1]`).

Note: We can assign and print by wrapping the entire line of code in parantheses.
```{r}
( counts <- c(2, 3, 0, 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1) )
```

Note: we use the arrow keys to retrieve previous commands. Each command is stored in the history file. The up-arrow key moves backwards through the history file. The left and right arrow keys move the cursor along the line.
 
### Functions

We apply functions to data that are stored in objects. For example:
```{r}
sum(counts)
length(counts)
sum(counts)/length(counts)
mean(counts)
```

The function `sum()` totals the hurricane counts over all years, `length()` returns the number of elements in the vector. Other functions include, `sort()`, `min()`, `max()`, `range()`, `diff()`, and `cumsum()`. Try these functions on the landfall counts. What does the function `range()` return?  What does the function `diff()` do?

### Data vectors

The hurricane count data stored in the object `counts` is a vector. This means that R keeps track of the order that the data were entered. There is a first element, a second element, and so on. This is good for several reasons.

The vector of counts has a natural order; year 1, year 2, etc. We don't want to mix these. We would like to be able to make changes to the data item by item instead of entering the values again. Also, vectors are math objects so that math operations can be performed on them.

For example, suppose `counts` contain the annual landfall count from the first decade of a longer record.  We want to keep track of counts over other decades. This could be done by the following, example.
```{r}
d1 <- counts
d2 <- c(0, 5, 4, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 1)
```

Most functions operate on each element of the data vector at the same time.
```{r}
d1 + d2
```

The first year of the first decade is added from the first year of the second decade and so on.

What happens if we apply the `c()` function to these two vectors?  Try it.
```{r}
c(d1, d2)
```

If we are interested in each year's count as a difference from the decade mean, we type:
```{r}
d1 - mean(d1)
```

In this case a single number (the mean of the first decade) is subtracted from a vector. The result is from subtracting the number from each entry in the data vector. This is an example of data recycling. R repeats values from one vector so that the vector lengths match. Here the mean is repeated 10 times.

#### Variance

Suppose we are interested in the variance of the set of landfall counts. The variance is computed as
$$
\hbox{var}(x) = \frac{(x_1 - \bar x)^2 + (x_2 - \bar x)^2 + \cdots + (x_n - \bar x)^2}{n-1} = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar x)^2
$$

Although the `var()` function computes this, here we see how to do this using simpler functions. The key is to find the squared differences and then sum.
```{r}
x <- d1
xbar <- mean(x)
x - xbar
(x - xbar)^2
sum((x - xbar)^2)
n <- length(x)
n
sum((x - xbar)^2)/(n - 1)
var(x)
```

### Vector types

Elements in a vector must all be of the same type. This type can be numeric as in counts or character strings as in
```{r}
simpsons <- c('Homer', 'Marge', 'Bart', 'Lisa', 'Maggie')
simpsons
```

Character strings are made with matching quotes, either double, `"`, or single, `'`. If we mix types the values will be coerced into a common type, which is usually a character string. Arithmetic operations do not work on character strings.

Returning to the land falling hurricane counts. Now suppose the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reanalyzes a storm, and that the 6th year of the 2nd decade is a 1 rather than a 0 for the number of landfalls. In this case we type:
```{r}
d2[6] <- 1
```

This assigns to the 6th year of the decade a value of one. The assignment to the 6th entry in the vector `d2` is done by referencing the entry with square brackets `[]`. 

Keep this straight: Parentheses `()` are used for functions and square brackets `[]` are used to extract values from vectors (and arrays, lists, etc).
```{r}
d2
d2[2]
d2[-4]
d2[c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)]
```

The first line prints all the values of the vector `df2`. The second prints only the 2nd value of the vector. The third prints all but the 4th value. The fourth prints the values with odd element numbers.

### Structured data

Sometimes we need to create structured data. For example, the integers 1 through 99. To enter these we use the `:` operator.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
1:99
rev(1:99)
99:1
```

The `seq()` function is more general than `:`. We specify the sequence interval with the `by =` or `length =` arguments.
```{r}
seq(from = 1, to = 9, by = 2)
seq(1, 10, by = 2)
seq(1, 9, length = 5)
```

The `rep()` function is to create repetitive sequences. The first argument is a value or vector that we want repeated and the second argument is the number of times we want it repeated.
```{r}
rep(1, times = 10)
rep(simpsons, times = 2)
```

In the second example the vector `simpsons` containing the Simpson characters is repeated twice.

To repeat each element of the vector use the `each =` argument.
```{r}
rep(simpsons, each = 2)
```

More complicated patterns can be repeated by specifying pairs of equal-sized vectors. In this case, each element of the first vector is repeated the corresponding number of times specified by the element in the second vector.
```{r}
rep(c("long", "short"), c(2, 3))
```

### Query data

To find the maximum number of landfalls in the first decade we type.
```{r}
max(d1)
```

Which years had the maximum?
```{r}
d1 == 3
```

Notice the double equals signs (`==`).  This tests each value in `d1` to see if it is equal to 3. The 2nd and 4th values are equal to 3 so `TRUE`s are returned. Think of this as asking R a question. Is the value equal to 3?  R answers all at once with a vector of `TRUE`'s and `FALSE`'s.

Now the question is -- how do you get the vector element corresponding to the `TRUE` values?  That is, which years have 3 landfalls?
```{r}
which(d1 == 3)
```

The function `which.max()` can be used to get the first maximum.
```{r}
which.max(d1)
```

We might also want to know the total number of landfalls in each decade and the number of years in a decade without a landfall. Or how about the ratio of the mean number of landfalls over the two decades.
```{r}
sum(d1)
sum(d2)
sum(d1 == 0)
sum(d2 == 0)
mean(d2)/mean(d1)
```

So there is 85% more landfalls during the second decade. Is this difference statistically significant?

To remove an object from the environment use the `rm()` function.
```{r}
rm(d1, d2)
```

## Need additional help? Try swirl

The package **swirl** contains functions to help you learn the basics of R. The `install.packages()` function gets the package from an CRAN mirror site. This needs to be done only once to your local computer. You can update packages using `update.packages()`. To make the functions work in your current session you must use the `library()` function. This needs to be done for every session, but only once per session.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("swirl")
library(swirl)
```

Type:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
swirl()
```

## Data Frames

**"Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight."** --- Bill Gates

A data frame is used for storing data tables. It is a list of vectors of equal length. For example, the following variable `df` is a data frame containing three vectors `n`, `s`, `b`.
```{r}
n <- c(2, 3, 5) 
s <- c("aa", "bb", "cc") 
b <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE) 

df <- data.frame(n, s, b)
```

There are many built-in data frames. For example, here is a built-in data frame in R, called `mtcars`.
```{r}
mtcars 
```

The top line of the table, called the header, contains the column names. Each horizontal line afterward denotes a data row, which begins with the name of the row, and then followed by the actual data. Each data member of a row is called a cell.

To retrieve data in a cell, we would enter its row and column coordinates in the single square bracket `[]` operator. The two coordinates are separated by a comma. In other words, the coordinates begins with row position, then followed by a comma, and ends with the column position. The order is important.

Here is the cell value from the first row, second column of mtcars.
```{r}
mtcars[1, 2]
```

We can use the row and column names instead of the numeric coordinates.
```{r}
mtcars["Mazda RX4", "cyl"] 
```

The number of data rows in the data frame is given by the `nrow()` function.
```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
```

The number of columns of a data frame is given by the `ncol()` function.
```{r}
ncol(mtcars)
```

Further details of the `mtcars` data set is available in the R documentation.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(mtcars)
```

Instead of printing out the entire data frame, it is often desirable to preview it with the `head()` function beforehand.
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```

Or with the `str()` function.
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

### Another example

Consider answers on questions given to all students in an introductory statistics class at Bowling Green State University. Some of the questions were: What is your height? Choose a number between 1 and 10. Give the time you went to bed last night. The data are available as a data frame called `studentdata` in the package **LearnBayes**.

First, install the package.
```{r}
# install.packages("LearnBayes")
library(LearnBayes)
```

Next, make a copy of the data frame and call it `df`. Then print the first six rows using the `head()` function and list only the 10th row.
```{r}
df <- LearnBayes::studentdata
head(df)
```

Recall data frames are like spreadsheets with rows and columns. The rows are the observations and the columns are the variables. All columns are of the same length like a matrix. We identify particular data elements of the matrix using the bracket notation [row, column] where row is the row number and column is the column number.

For example here we identify all the columns in the 10th row.
```{r}
df[10, ]
```

Drink preference was one of the questions. The responses are available in the column labeled `Drink` as a vector. We identify this vector using the `$` notation, where the name before the dollar sign identifies the data frame and the name after the dollar sign identifies the column name (`dataframeName$columnName`). 

So we list all the drink preferences using
```{r}
df$Drink
```

Note that some students left that response blank. That is coded as `<NA>`.

The names of the columns is available with the `names()` function.
```{r}
names(df)
```

We can table the responses with the `table()` function.
```{r}
table(df$Drink)

table(df$Drink,
      useNA = "ifany")
```

The numbers are the frequency of responses by `Drink` category.

Use the `plot()` method to make a plot of this table.
```{r}
plot(x = df$Drink)
```

Suppose we are interested in examining how long students slept. This was not asked directly. We compute it from the `ToSleep` and `WakeUp` times columns. We assign the result of the difference to a column we call `SleepHrs`.
```{r}
df$SleepHrs <- df$WakeUp - df$ToSleep
summary(df$SleepHrs)
```

To see the distribution of sleep times, we construct a histogram with the `hist()` function.
```{r}
hist(x = df$SleepHrs)
```

The histogram function divides the number of sleep hours into one-hour bins and counts the number of students whose computed number of sleep hours falls into each bin. For example based on when they said they went to sleep and when the said they woke up, about 100 students slept between five and six hours the night before the survey.

Since the gender of each student is recorded, we can make comparisons between those who identify as male and those who identify as female. For instance, do men sleep more than women? We can answer this question graphically with box plots.
```{r}
plot(x = df$Gender, 
     y = df$SleepHrs)
```

No apparent difference.

Repeat for hair cut prices.
```{r}
plot(x = df$Gender, 
     y = df$Haircut)
```

Big difference.

Finally, is the amount of sleep for a student related to bedtime?
```{r}
plot(x = df$ToSleep,
     y = df$SleepHrs)
```

The `ToSleep` variable is centered on midnight so that -2 means they went to sleep at 10p.

We describe the decreasing relationship by drawing a line through the points. The least-squares line is fit using the `lm()` function and the line is drawn on the existing plot with the `abline()` function applied to the linear regression object `model`.
```{r}
model <- lm(SleepHrs ~ ToSleep, 
            data = df)

plot(x = df$ToSleep,
     y = df$SleepHrs)
abline(model)
```

### Tornadoes in the United States

We download the data from the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) http://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis/zipped/. We give the zipped file a temporary name on our computer (here `temporary.zip`) using the `destfile =` argument.
```{r}
download.file(url = "http://www.spc.noaa.gov/gis/svrgis/zipped/1950-2018-torn-initpoint.zip",
              destfile = "temporary.zip")
```

Next we open the zipped file with the `unzip()` function. This creates a folder in our working directory called `1950-2018-torn-initpoint`.
```{r}
unzip("temporary.zip")
```

Finally we load the shapefile into R. We use the `read_sf()` function from the **sf** package. We specify the data source name `dsn =`. The name of the file exists outside of R in your project directory so it needs to be inside quotes (either single or double).
```{r}
library(sf)

Torn.sf <- read_sf(dsn = "1950-2018-torn-initpoint")
```

Much more about working with shapefiles and spatial data frames throughout the semester.

We preview the resulting data frame
```{r}
head(Torn.sf)
```

Each row is a unique tornado report. Observations for each report include the date and time, the state (`st`), the maximum EF rating (`mag`), the number of injuries (`inj`), the number of fatalities (`fat`), estimated property losses (`loss`), estimated crop losses (`closs`), start and end locations in decimal degrees longitude and latitude, length of the damage path in yards (`len`), width of the damage path in miles (`wid`). 

There is also a column called `geometry` indicating the spatial information.

The total number of tornado reports in the database is returned from the `nrow()` function.
```{r}
nrow(Torn.sf)
```

Create a subset of the data frame keeping only tornadoes in years (`yr`) since 2001 and with EF ratings (`mag`) greater than 0. First we create a logical operation
```{r}
Torn.sf <- Torn.sf[Torn.sf$yr >= 2001 & Torn.sf$mag > 0, ]
```

Compute the correlation between EF rating (`mag`) and path length (`len`) and path width (`wid`). 
```{r}
cor(Torn.sf$mag, Torn.sf$len)
cor(Torn.sf$mag, Torn.sf$wid)
```

Path length is recorded in miles and path width in yards. To convert them to meters and add the converted values as new columns, type
```{r}
Torn.sf$Length <- Torn.sf$len * 1609.34
Torn.sf$Width <- Torn.sf$wid * .9144
```

Create side-by-side box plots of path length (in kilometers) by EF rating.
```{r}
plot(x = factor(Torn.sf$mag), 
     y = Torn.sf$Length/1000)
```

Create a scatter plot with the size of the point proportional to the EF rating.
```{r}
plot(x = log(Torn.sf$Width), 
     y = log(Torn.sf$Length), 
     cex = Torn.sf$mag)
```

Create a map of tornado genesis locations. First get a file containing the U.S. state borders. Then plot the geometry column and overlay the tornado location as points.
```{r}
library(USAboundaries)

sts <- state.name[!state.name %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii")]
stateBorders <- us_states(states = sts)

plot(stateBorders$geometry,
     col = "grey")
plot(Torn.sf$geometry, 
     pch = ".", 
     col = "red",
     add = TRUE)
```

### Hurricanes in the United States

We load data directly from the web by specifying the URL as a character string using the `file =` argument.
```{r}
df <- read.table(file = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/US.txt", 
                 header = TRUE)
```

The object `df` is a data frame. A data frame is like a spreadsheet. Values are arranged in rows and columns. Rows are the cases (observations) and columns are the variables. The `dim()` function returns the size of the data frame defined as the number of rows and the number of columns (in that order).
```{r}
dim(df)
```

There are 166 rows and 6 columns in the data frame object `df`.

To get a glimpse of the data values we list the first six lines of the data frame using the `head()` function.
```{r}
head(df)
```

The columns include `Year`, number of hurricanes (`All`), number of major hurricanes (`MUS`), number of Gulf coast hurricanes (`G`), number of Florida hurricanes (`FL`), and number of East coast hurricanes (`E`) in that order. The last six lines of your data frame are listed using the `tail()` function.
```{r}
tail(df)
```

The distribution of Florida hurricane counts by year is obtained using the `table()` function and specifying the `FL` column with `df$FL`.
```{r}
table(df$FL)
```

There are 93 years without a FL hurricane, 43 years with exactly one hurricane, 24 years with two hurricanes, and so on.

The columns in a data frame are referenced using the `df$name` syntax, where `name` refers to the column name.
```{r}
df$FL
sum(df$FL)
```

Each column is a vector of length equal to the number of rows in the data frame.

How many hurricanes hit Florida in 1906?
```{r}
df$FL[df$Year == 1906]
```

The operator `==` returns a logical vector of length equal to the number of rows in `df` with values of `TRUE` and `FALSE`. The subset operator `[` returns the value of the vector `df$FL` when the logical vector is true.

What years had the most East coast hurricanes?
```{r}
df$Year[which(df$E == max(df$E))]
```

As I mentioned last week, there are many functions for working with data frames using **base** R. These functions require understanding data frames as 'list' objects, which makes them harder to learn and to remember.

From the **readr** package as part of the **tidyverse** dialect we can use the `read_table()` function to create a tabled data frame.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_table(file = "http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/US.txt")
```

There are many functions for working with data frames using **base** R. These functions require understanding data frames as list objects, which makes them harder to learn and to remember. Next time will explore a more formalized grammar for data wrangling.

### Your turn: Precipitation in Florida

Source: Monthly climate series. [Source:](http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/)

Get monthly statewide average rainfall (in inches) back to the year 1895. Copy/paste into a text editor (I use the app TextWrangler) then import into R using the `read.table()` function.

I did this and posted the file on my website. Missing values are coded as -9.900 so I included the argument `na.string = "-9.900"` in the function call.
```{r}
df <- read.table("http://myweb.fsu.edu/jelsner/temp/data/FLprecip.txt", 
                 na.string = "-9.900", 
                 header = TRUE)
head(df)
```

* What was the statewide average rainfall during the 10th month of the 65th year?
* What was the statewide average rainfall during June of 1900?
* What year had the wettest March?
* What month during 1965 was the wettest?

### More practice: More tornadoes

Use the tornado dataset from the Storm Prediction Center and write code to do or answer the following.

* List the names of the columns in the data frame.
* What is the last year in the data?
* How many tornadoes had at least one fatality?
* Create a table of the number of tornadoes by EF rating.
* Create a table of the number of tornadoes by state.
* Add a new variable to the data frame called `area` as the product of the path length and path width in units of square meters.
* Map the locations of all the tornadoes with an EF rating of at least 4.
